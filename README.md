===

[create-cycle-app](https://github.com/cyclejs-community/create-cycle-app) flavor with all of my personal preferences.

Starring:

 * Semicolons!
 * browserify
 * babel
 * the object spread babel plugin with a really long name!

Setup
---

```bash
npm install create-cycle-app -g

create-cycle-app <appname> --flavor cycle-scripts-widdershin
```

Where `<appname>` is the name of the directory you'd like to create your new Cycle app in.

You can also just pass `.` to use the current directory.


```bash
cd <appname>

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

npm start
```

Then, browse to `localhost:8000`. You should see a purple "Hello world".
